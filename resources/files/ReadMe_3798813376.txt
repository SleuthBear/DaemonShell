This repository holds the source code for the DaemonShell program, including peripheral libraries. To execute or restart the program, each peripheral library must be validated first.
A validation script is available in this folder, and typing "imp run validation" will execute it. Imp will read out the results.
DO NOT attempt to launch DaemonShell.exe without validating the libraries. This could have catastophic consequences.
