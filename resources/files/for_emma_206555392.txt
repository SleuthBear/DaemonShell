Dear Emma,

I hope you and Jacob are well, it has been a long time.
I am writing to you to inform you that I do not approve of your recent investment. While I appreciate you have always enjoyed
gambling I am shocked. Mother has told me that you have spent a considerable amount of money purchasing stocks in Apple.
I work in technology, and can tell you that this is a FAD. The graphical user interface is an incredibly convoluted idea.
It simply lacks the flexibility of command line arguments, and the "mouse"? That will never catch on.

Please reconsider and sell your stocks before this farsical company crashes.

Kind Regards,
Your Brother Adalbert
