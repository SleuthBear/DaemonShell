DaemonShell is a prototype game written in Odin using FreeType, OpenGL and GLFW. 
Other depedencies are from the Odin core library.

The game uses a virtual file system, and emulates extremely basic functionality of a unix terminal.

To run the game "odin run ." should compile within a second or two.
